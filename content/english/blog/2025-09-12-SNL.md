Just back from the annual Society for the Neurobiology of Language conference, this year hosted by Gallaudet.

While there, Laurie presented recent work with lab-alum Ehsan Solaimani looking at the timecourse of parsing morphologically complex words, using GAMMs to estimate interactions between various frequency measures and time.  She also ran into lab alum William van Boxtel, presenting the first project from his new lab at LSU.

All in all, it was a great opportunity to catch up with friends old and new, and visit the beautiful Gallaudet campus.  It was also a masterclass in making equity and accessibility work for everyone -- if only every conference had a team of interpreters, and live supertitles!
